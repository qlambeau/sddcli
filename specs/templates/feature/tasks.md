# Tasks

<!-- Tasks turn an approved design into an ordered implementation plan. Each
task should have a concrete completion check and should not silently change the
requirements or design. -->

## Implementation Approach

TBD

## Ordered Tasks

- [ ] **TASK-NNN-1 (RED):** Write failing unit / integration tests covering specified behavior.
  - Depends on: None
  - Verification: Tests fail with expected error output.
- [ ] **TASK-NNN-2 (GREEN):** Implement minimal production code to satisfy TASK-NNN-1.
  - Depends on: TASK-NNN-1
  - Verification: Tests pass green.
- [ ] **TASK-NNN-3:** CLI and acceptance integration covering `scenarios.feature`.
  - Depends on: TASK-NNN-2
  - Verification: All scenarios pass.

## Test And Verification Plan

- [ ] Unit checks: TBD
- [ ] Integration checks: TBD
- [ ] Gherkin scenarios: `scenarios.feature`
- [ ] Quality gates: the .NET gate suite in `specs/CONSTITUTION.md` §13 (when C#/.NET code is in scope)
- [ ] Quality gates: the frontend gate suite in `specs/CONSTITUTION_FRONTEND.md` §13 (when `Web.Spa` code is in scope)
- [ ] Non-functional checks: TBD

## Rollout And Recovery
